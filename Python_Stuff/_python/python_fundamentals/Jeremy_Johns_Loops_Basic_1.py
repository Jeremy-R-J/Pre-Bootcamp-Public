# # Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# low = 2
# high = 18
# mult = 6

# for i in range (low, high+1):
#     if i % mult == 0:
#         print (i)
